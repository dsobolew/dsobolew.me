Instead, the name comes from the weekly Tidy Tuesday(https://github.com/rfordatascience## French Train Schedules

      <description>Hi, my name is Dennis Sobolewski and I am a data scientist. I created this site to share my work and hopefully learn along the way. Stay tuned for a more in depth &amp;ldquo;About me&amp;rdquo; section in the future, but for now I am just trying to get some posts up.
